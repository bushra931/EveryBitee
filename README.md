## About the Project

In India, 88% of people don't read or understand food labels, which leads to poor dietary decisions. This lack of awareness contributes to:

- Lifestyle diseases (e.g., diabetes, obesity, anemia)
- Environmental degradation
- Lack of access to personalized nutrition (especially in rural areas)

EveryBite addresses these challenges by helping users understand what they eat — from nutritional value to environmental impact.

- Unawareness about food labels  
- High risk of lifestyle-related diseases
